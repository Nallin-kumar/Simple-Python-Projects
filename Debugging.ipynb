    "Syntax error\n",
    "Logical error\n",
    "Runtime error\n",
    "Stack Overflow\n",
    "Index Out of Bound Errors\n",

    "Debugging Tools\n",
    "A debugging tool is a computer program that is used to test and debug other programs. A lot of public domain software like gdb and dbx are available for debugging. They offer console-based command-line interfaces. Examples of automated debugging tools include code-based tracers, profilers, interpreters, etc. Some of the widely used debuggers are:\n",

    "Radare2\n",
    "WinDbg\n",
    "Valgrind\n",
    "Difference Between Debugging and Testing\n",
    "Debugging is different from testing. Testing focuses on finding bugs, errors, etc whereas debugging starts after a bug has been identified in the software. Testing is used to ensure that the program is correct and it was supposed to do with a certain minimum success rate. Testing can be manual or automated. There are several different types of testing unit testing, integration testing, alpha, and beta testing, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging requires a lot of knowledge, skills, and expertise. It can be supported by some automated tools available but is more of a manual process as every bug is different and requires a different technique, unlike a pre-defined testing mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Debugging\n",
    "Several advantages of debugging in software engineering:\n",
    "Improved system quality: By identifying and resolving bugs, a software system can be made more reliable and efficient, resulting in improved overall quality.\n",
    "Reduced system downtime: By identifying and resolving bugs, a software system can be made more stable and less likely to experience downtime, which can result in improved availability for users.\n",
    "Increased user satisfaction: By identifying and resolving bugs, a software system can be made more user-friendly and better able to meet the needs of users, which can result in increased satisfaction.\n",
    "Reduced development costs: Identifying and resolving bugs early in the development process, can save time and resources that would otherwise be spent on fixing bugs later in the development process or after the system has been deployed.\n",
    "Increased security: By identifying and resolving bugs that could be exploited by attackers, a software system can be made more secure, reducing the risk of security breaches.\n",
    "Facilitates change: With debugging, it becomes easy to make changes to the software as it becomes easy to identify and fix bugs that would have been caused by the changes.\n",
    "Better understanding of the system: Debugging can help developers gain a better understanding of how a software system works, and how different components of the system interact with one another.\n",
    "Facilitates testing: By identifying and resolving bugs, it makes it easier to test the software and ensure that it meets the requirements and specifications.\n",
    "In summary, debugging is an important aspect of software engineering as it helps to improve system quality, reduce system downtime, increase user satisfaction, reduce development costs, increase security, facilitate change, a better understanding of the system, and facilitate testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Debugging\n",
    "While debugging is an important aspect of software engineering, there are also some disadvantages to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-consuming: Debugging can be a time-consuming process, especially if the bug is difficult to find or reproduce. This can cause delays in the development process and add to the overall cost of the project.\n",
    "Requires specialized skills: Debugging can be a complex task that requires specialized skills and knowledge. This can be a challenge for developers who are not familiar with the tools and techniques used in debugging.\n",
    "Can be difficult to reproduce: Some bugs may be difficult to reproduce, which can make it challenging to identify and resolve them.\n",
    "Can be difficult to diagnose: Some bugs may be caused by interactions between different The components of a software system can make it challenging to identify the root cause of a problem. Some bugs may be caused by fundamental design flaws or architecture issues, making them difficult or impossible to fix without significant changes to the software system.\n",
    "Limited insight: In some cases, debugging tools can only provide limited insight into the problem and may not provide enough information to identify the root cause of the problem.\n",
    "Can be expensive: Debugging can be an expensive process, especially if it requires additional resources such as specialized debugging tools or additional development time."
